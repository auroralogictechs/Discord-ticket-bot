## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or Download the Bot Files

Place all bot files in a dedicated folder.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the bot folder with the following keys:

DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
MAIN_GUILD_ID=your_main_guild_id
SUPPORT_GUILD_ID=your_support_guild_id
STAFF_ROLE_ID=your_staff_role_id
TICKET_CATEGORY_ID=your_ticket_category_id
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key (optional)


Alternatively, use the `setup_bot_folder.bat` script to generate this `.env` file automatically with placeholder values.

### 3. Install Dependencies

Run the `setup_bot.bat` Windows batch script to:

- Verify Python installation
- Install required packages:
  - discord.py (>=2.3.2)
  - python-dotenv (>=1.0.0)
  - openai (>=0.28.0)
- Check that `.env` file exists

Or manually install via:

pip install "discord.py>=2.3.2" "python-dotenv>=1.0.0" "openai>=0.28.0"

### 4. Start the Bot

Run the bot with:
python main_bot.py

Or use the `start_bot.bat` script on Windows.

## Usage

### Slash Commands

- `/setup [channel]`  
  Sets up the ticket system panel with a "Create Ticket" button in the specified text channel or current channel if none provided. Requires `Manage Guild` permission.

- `/close <ticket_id>`  
  (Staff only) Closes an open ticket by ticket ID.

- `/ticket_info <ticket_id>`  
  (Staff only) Retrieves detailed information about a ticket.

### Ticket Workflow

- Users click the "Create Ticket" button or send a DM to the bot.
- A ticket is created if the user has no open ticket, including a private support channel.
- Messages from users in DM are forwarded to support channels.
- Staff replies in support channels are forwarded to users via DM.
- Staff can close tickets via button or command.
- Users may request instant AI help by sending a DM starting with `ai:` (e.g., `ai: How to reset my password?`).

## Database

- Uses SQLite database named `tickets.db`.
- Tables:
  - `tickets` - stores ticket metadata (id, user, status, channel id, timestamps).
  - `ticket_messages` - stores message history for tickets.

---

## Permissions & Roles

- Only users with the configured `STAFF_ROLE_ID` can close tickets or view ticket details.
- Ticket support channels are created with permissions set for staff and hidden from everyone else.
- Make sure your bot has the necessary permissions to manage channels and read/send messages.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If Python is not detected, install Python 3.8+ and add it to PATH.
- Check `.env` file is correctly populated and placed in the bot directory.
- In the Discord Developer Portal, ensure privileged gateway intents are enabled.
- Ensure the bot has appropriate role permissions on your servers.
- If users cannot receive DMs, advise them to check privacy settings allowing DMs from server members.
